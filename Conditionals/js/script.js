//Conditional Logic- Relational Expressions

//Kids over 48 inches are able to ride roller coaster, but under 48 inches, they're not.

//Store kid height in variable

var kidHeight = 30; //Kid is 30 inches tall

//If the child is old enough, print to the console "You can ride!"
//If the kid is over 48 inches in height. If the kidHeight is > (greater than)

if(kidHeight > 48){
